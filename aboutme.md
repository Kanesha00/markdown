#Who am I?#
My name is ***Kanesha Williams*** I attend Franklin D. Roosevelt high school as of now I'm a Junior in the H-tech program taking the Information Technology pathway. I'm the oldest girl out of all of my siblings I have an older step brother a younger brother and three younger sisters. I am a family person and they give me various nicknames such as pumpkin or pumpkin pooh because of my birthday being on Halloween. Honestly I don't live up to the stereotype of being a devil child or evil because of being born on Halloween. Actually I'm the complete opposite some people think I'm too nice and humble in a way and they would rather me be more aggressive.

##My Social Life##
Most certainly I'm someone who can not sit around doing nothing when there are so many hours in the day there is always something that needs to be done. That's why I'm always involved with whatever I can participate in but I would not want to overload my plate so I try to make sure that I'm aware of what I'm getting myself into. People always tell me that I'm boring or I need to loosen up a little and have fun or that I take things too serious but I rather work hard and then save the playing for later. Also I'm more of an introvert person I have a few friends and that's about it because I don't think it's necessary to have a huge circle of people to call friends.

##Why am I here?##
Although many scholars are here simply because their parents want them to be that's definitely not the case for me I'm here for myself and no other reason. If anybody had the opportunity to have an associates degree for free and all they have to do is hold up their end of the bargain then why not go ahead and take the courses. I'm here because I want to be able to have some education besides just a diploma under my belt when I graduate. I want my younger siblings to look at me as a role model that they wouldn't mind following they should be able to say if she could do it then I can too. I'm here because this also gives me a chance to have a different mindset when I go to a four year University I'll be more equipped and prepared for challenges that I'll have to soon face. I'm here to take advantage of what some will over look and then look back and regret it. I'm here to make my family proud of me as well as those who look up to me.

Then one day I want to get married and have a decent sized wedding with both sides of our family and friends there to witness the vows. I want the wedding venue to be extravagant a beach wedding with lots of fresh flowers and every one wearing floral colors while I'll have on a white dress. After our vows have been said I want to jump the broom although it isn't a tradition for our family I just want to do it because I've seen it in a movie. ~~I want to have five kids.~~
